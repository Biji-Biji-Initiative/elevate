# Badges (Draft)

Principle
- Actions earn points. When requirements are met, the badge is awarded automatically. Points do not directly grant badges; meeting the criteria does (some criteria are based on point totals).

Stage Badges (awarded on first approval of that stage)
- Learn Complete: first APPROVED Learn submission.
- Explore Complete: first APPROVED Explore submission.
- Amplify Activated: first APPROVED Amplify submission.
- Present Complete: first APPROVED Present submission.
- Shine Nominee: admin-awarded recognition.

Milestone Badges (awarded when total points cross threshold)
- Rising Star: >= 50 total points.
- Trailblazer: >= 100 total points.
- Champion: >= 200 total points.

Notes
- Badges are cosmetic (no extra points). They signal progress and recognition.
- Criteria are computed on approval events and periodically for consistency.
- Badge art and localization TBD.
