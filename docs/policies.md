## Privacy & Publication Policies (Draft)

- PII is never displayed on public pages except on public profiles with explicit consent per submission.
- Each submission has a visibility toggle (Public/Private). Default is Private.
- Public metrics pages only show aggregates by stage; no PII.
- Evidence files remain private; public profiles show thumbnails or masked info as needed.
- Data retention: submissions and ledger retained for program duration + compliance window (TBD).
- Access: roles (participant, reviewer, admin) with least privilege; all admin actions logged.
