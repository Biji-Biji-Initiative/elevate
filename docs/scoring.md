# Scoring Rules (Draft)

Base Points
- Learn: +20 upon approval (one qualifying certificate per educator).
- Explore: +50 upon approval.
- Amplify: +2 per peer trained; +1 per student trained; evidence of attendance required.
- Present: +20 upon approval (LinkedIn URL + screenshot).
- Shine: recognition badge; optional bonus points TBD.

Amplify Caps (Proposal)
- Per-month caps to reduce gaming:
  - Peers: max 50 per month.
  - Students: max 200 per month.
- Justification: keep points proportional and verifiable.

Ledger
- All points added to `points_ledger` with source (FORM/WEBHOOK/MANUAL) and optional external event id.

Badges (see badges.md)
- Award stage badges on first approval per stage; award milestone badges when crossing point thresholds (50/100/200).
- Approval action triggers badge evaluation; periodic re-check to prevent drift.
