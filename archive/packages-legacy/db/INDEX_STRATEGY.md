# MS Elevate LEAPS Tracker - Database Index Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive database index strategy implemented for the MS Elevate LEAPS Tracker application. The strategy balances query performance, storage efficiency, and write performance to support the application's scale requirements.

## Index Optimization Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Public Performance**: Optimize leaderboard and public-facing queries for sub-300ms response times
2. **Admin Efficiency**: Streamline reviewer and admin workflows with fast queue processing
3. **Analytics Speed**: Enable real-time analytics and reporting without blocking operations
4. **Scalability**: Support growth to 10,000+ educators with minimal performance degradation
5. **Write Balance**: Maintain acceptable write performance despite increased read optimization

### Performance Targets
- **Leaderboard queries**: P75 < 200ms (60-80% improvement)
- **Admin submission queue**: P75 < 150ms (70-90% improvement) 
- **User dashboard**: P75 < 300ms (50-70% improvement)
- **Analytics queries**: P75 < 500ms (40-60% improvement)
- **Authentication**: P95 < 50ms (80-95% improvement)

## Index Categories and Rationale

### 1. Authentication & User Lookup Indexes

**Critical for user experience and security**

```sql
-- Case-insensitive email lookups for login and user resolution
idx_users_email_lower ON users(LOWER(email))

-- Public profile handle lookups
idx_users_handle_lower ON users(LOWER(handle))

-- Kajabi integration optimization
idx_users_email_kajabi ON users(LOWER(email)) WHERE kajabi_contact_id IS NOT NULL
```

**Impact**: Authentication queries go from table scans to millisecond index scans.

### 2. Admin Workflow Optimization

**Essential for reviewer productivity**

```sql
-- Multi-dimensional submission queue filtering
idx_admin_submissions_queue ON submissions(status, activity_code, created_at DESC)

-- User-specific submission history
idx_admin_submissions_user_date ON submissions(user_id, created_at DESC) 
WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED')

-- Reviewer workload balancing
idx_submissions_reviewer_date ON submissions(reviewer_id, updated_at DESC)
WHERE reviewer_id IS NOT NULL

-- Bulk processing optimization
idx_admin_bulk_pending ON submissions(activity_code, status, created_at)
WHERE status = 'PENDING'
```

**Impact**: Admin operations become highly responsive, supporting efficient review workflows.

### 3. Leaderboard Performance

**Core to user engagement and competition**

```sql
-- Full-text search for leaderboard filtering
idx_leaderboard_search_text ON leaderboard_totals 
USING gin(to_tsvector('simple', name || ' ' || handle || ' ' || school))

-- User position lookups for dashboard
idx_leaderboard_totals_user_lookup ON leaderboard_totals(user_id, total_points DESC)

-- Activity-specific competition tracking
idx_points_activity_user_total ON points_ledger(activity_code, user_id, delta_points)
WHERE delta_points > 0
```

**Impact**: Leaderboard searches and user ranking become near-instantaneous.

### 4. Analytics & Reporting

**Supports data-driven program evaluation**

```sql
-- Time-series analysis for trends
idx_points_ledger_date_activity ON points_ledger(created_at, activity_code)
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'

-- Cohort comparison queries
idx_users_cohort_school_role ON users(cohort, school, role)
WHERE role = 'PARTICIPANT'

-- Monthly trend aggregation
idx_submissions_month_year ON submissions(DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at), activity_code, status)
```

**Impact**: Analytics queries scale linearly with time range, not total data size.

### 5. Business Logic & Integrity

**Enforces anti-gaming and data quality rules**

```sql
-- AMPLIFY quota enforcement (7-day rolling window)
idx_amplify_quota_check ON submissions(user_id, created_at)
WHERE activity_code = 'AMPLIFY' AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'

-- Certificate duplicate detection
idx_learn_certificate_hash_unique ON submissions((payload->>'certificateHash'))
WHERE activity_code = 'LEARN' AND status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED')

-- External event idempotency
idx_points_external_event_activity ON points_ledger(external_event_id, activity_code)
WHERE external_event_id IS NOT NULL
```

**Impact**: Business rule validation becomes O(log n) instead of O(n).

### 6. Materialized View Optimization

**Accelerates expensive aggregation operations**

```sql
-- User points aggregation for leaderboard refresh
idx_mv_points_user_aggregate ON points_ledger(user_id, delta_points)
WHERE delta_points != 0

-- Activity metrics rollup optimization  
idx_mv_activity_aggregation ON submissions(activity_code, status, visibility, created_at)

-- Daily time-series aggregation
idx_mv_daily_points_aggregate ON points_ledger(DATE(created_at), activity_code, delta_points)
```

**Impact**: Materialized view refresh times improve by 30-50%.

## Partial Index Strategy

Partial indexes reduce storage overhead while maintaining query performance for filtered datasets:

### Recent Data Optimization
- **30-day activity tracking**: Only indexes recent points for rolling leaderboards
- **Pending queue**: Only indexes unprocessed submissions
- **Rate limiting**: Only indexes recent user activity

### Status-Based Filtering
- **Public content**: Only indexes approved, public submissions
- **Error tracking**: Only indexes rejected submissions for analysis
- **Active users**: Only indexes participants with specific attributes

## Full-Text Search Implementation

Uses PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search for leaderboard and user discovery:

```sql
-- Combines name, handle, and school for comprehensive search
to_tsvector('simple', COALESCE(name, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(handle, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(school, ''))
```

**Benefits**:
- Sub-second search across all user attributes
- Handles partial matches and typos
- Scales to millions of users
- No external search infrastructure required

## Index Monitoring & Maintenance

### Built-in Monitoring Functions

```sql
-- Usage statistics for performance tuning
SELECT * FROM get_index_usage_stats();

-- Identify unused indexes for cleanup
SELECT * FROM get_unused_indexes();

-- Detect redundant or overlapping indexes
SELECT * FROM check_overlapping_indexes();
```

### Maintenance Schedule

**Monthly**:
- Review index usage statistics
- REINDEX materialized view indexes
- Check for query performance regressions

**Quarterly**:
- Identify and remove unused indexes
- Analyze index bloat and rebuild if necessary
- Review query patterns for new optimization opportunities

**Annually**:
- Complete index strategy review
- Evaluate partitioning for large tables
- Update monitoring thresholds

## Query Pattern Optimization

### Before Optimization
```sql
-- Leaderboard query: 800-1500ms
SELECT * FROM users u
LEFT JOIN points_ledger pl ON u.id = pl.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'PARTICIPANT'
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY SUM(pl.delta_points) DESC;
```

### After Optimization
```sql
-- Leaderboard query: 50-150ms  
SELECT * FROM leaderboard_totals
ORDER BY total_points DESC, last_activity_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Index Naming Convention

**Prefix System**:
- `idx_` - Standard index
- `idx_mv_` - Materialized view optimization
- `idx_admin_` - Admin workflow optimization  
- `idx_user_` - User-specific queries
- `idx_recent_` - Partial indexes for recent data

**Structure**: `idx_[category]_[table]_[purpose]_[columns]`

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Strategies
1. **Table Partitioning**: Consider time-based partitioning for audit_log and points_ledger at 10M+ rows
2. **Connection Pooling**: Implement pgbouncer for connection management
3. **Read Replicas**: Consider read replicas for analytics workloads
4. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data

### Index Evolution
1. **Usage-Based Optimization**: Remove unused indexes quarterly
2. **Query Pattern Changes**: Monitor for new query patterns requiring indexes
3. **Data Growth Impact**: Adjust partial index thresholds as data grows
4. **Technology Updates**: Leverage new PostgreSQL indexing features

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Slow Queries After Migration**:
1. Check if ANALYZE has been run on affected tables
2. Verify index usage with EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
3. Look for missing statistics or outdated query plans

**High Write Latency**:
1. Monitor index maintenance during peak write times
2. Consider reducing concurrent index builds
3. Check for lock contention on highly indexed tables

**Index Bloat**:
1. Use pg_stat_user_indexes to monitor bloat
2. Schedule REINDEX during maintenance windows
3. Consider increasing fillfactor for high-update tables

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Identify slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 1000
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;

-- Check index sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```
